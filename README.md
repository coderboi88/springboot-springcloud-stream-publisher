# springboot-springcloud-stream-publisher
We use Spring cloud stream so that instead of just using kafka we can also use other library like rabbitMQ etc

It is the producer/publisher appliccation. To use this project we also need consumer, so for consumer we have a project - 
"https://github.com/coderboi88/springboot-springcloud-stream-consumer". we need to clone this project also.
